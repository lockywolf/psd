Resurrected from a tar ball in 2018. Original README below. I suppose
this proves that software never dies...

PSD - THE PORTABLE SCHEME DEBUGGER 
VERSION 1.3, 1993

This is psd, the portable Scheme debugger. It does source code
debugging for any R4RS compliant Scheme interpreter when run in a
GNU Emacs buffer (either version 18 or 19). With psd you can
 * set and clear breakpoints
 * single step evaluation
 * examine and change the variables of the debugged program
 * follow execution in an editor window
 * run a program until a run time error occurs, and examine the state
   of the program

You can find the latest version of psd in
cs.tut.fi:/pub/src/languages/schemes. It is also available in the
Scheme repository at nexus.yorku.ca and its mirror sites, at least
ftp.inria.fr and faui80.informatik.uni-erlangen.de.

TO INSTALL AND RUN: see the manual in doc/

Psd is known to work with Aubrey Jaffer's scm, but porting to other
Schemes should be easy.  In fact, for a R4RS Scheme you should not
have "port" it at all. It works also with Elk v. 1.5 and the sci
interpreter in the Scheme->C system.

Files in the distribution:

* psd.scm		the generic main file that takes care of loading psd (2019-08-14: not found)
* psd-slib.scm		main file to be used with slib (2019-08-14: requires 'portable-scheme-debugger feature, provided by slib 3b5)
* psd-scm.scm    	ditto for scm without slib (you should really get slib) (2019-08-14: not found)

* cmuscheme.el		the CMU Scheme mode for GNU Emacs by Olin Shivers. (2019-08-14: available, but probably needs to be removed due to being shipped with Emacs)
* comint.el		support for cmuscheme.el (2019-08-14: needs to be removed due to being shipped with Emacs)

Comments, suggestions and bug reports are welcome.
